## Question

- Design an image carousel component that displays a list of images one at a time, allowing the user to browse through them with pagination buttons.

What questions should I ask?

- Where do the images come from? - I need the API to fetch the images
- Is this a multi-platform design, i.e. will the mobile design need to be different?
- When the carousel reaches the end image, do we go back to the start? Or do you have to go backwards?
- If you go back to the start, does the carousel go all the way back, or is it a continuous scroll?
- Are all the images the same size or do we need to address how to frame/crop images?
- Are the images optimised for different screens? Can we use srcset to help with that?
