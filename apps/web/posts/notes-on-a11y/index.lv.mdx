## What is web accessibility?

> Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web

Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought, though it is in most cases (from past experience). A web that is open to everyone is a web where there are no barriers; where everyone can contribute.

### Stats

1 in 4 of adults in the US have some form of disability, which increases to 2 in 5 aged 65 or over. That's a staggering amount of people with different forms of disability, who want to use and contribute to the web.

### Curb cut effect
This is the phenomenon where disability-friendly features begin to be used by people it wasn't designed for. The actual term comes from when wheelchair users in the US were unable to get on/off the pavement due to the sheer drop. In 1970, Michael Pachovas and a group of his friends went to a curb in Berkley, California and dumped cement on it, making it accessible [1]. 

### Aria 
It stands for accessible rich internet applications
