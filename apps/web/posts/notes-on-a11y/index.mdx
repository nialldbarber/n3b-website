## What is web accessibility?

> Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web

Accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought, though it is in most cases (from past experience). A web that is open to everyone is a web where there are no barriers; where everyone can contribute.

<h2>Stats</h2>

1 in 4 of adults in the US have some form of disability, which increases to 2 in 5 aged 65 or over. That's a staggering amount of people with different forms of disability, who want to use and contribute to the web.

### Curb cut effect

This is the phenomenon where disability-friendly features begin to be used by people it wasn't designed for. The actual term comes from when wheelchair users in the US were unable to get on/off the pavement due to the sheer drop. In 1970, Michael Pachovas and a group of his friends went to a curb in Berkley, California and dumped cement on it, making it accessible [<a href="#link_curb">1</a>]. The upshot of this act was not only to make navigating the streets of Berkley more accessible to everyone, it gradually became universal as it improved safety and the ease of movement of other modes of transport like strollers, wheeling luggage around and bicycles etc [<a href="#link_curb2">2</a>].

### Aria
